# newsboat-urls

This is a "urls" file used by the [newsboat console feed reader](https://newsboat.org) to fetch feeds. It's the file I use myself, and you're welcome to use it and add to it, too!

## How to Use

1. ```$ mkdir ~/.newsboat``` if you haven't already
2. Copy the "urls" file to ```~/.newsboat/urls``` or append its contents to your existing ```urls``` file.
3. Restart newsboat.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your favorite RSS/Atom feed URLs with tags or add tags to existing feeds.
3. Commit.
4. File a pull request.
5. If I don't merge within a day, hit me up on [Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@starbreaker) and remind me.

**Alternative for those unfamiliar with git and GitHub**

1. Go to "Issues". It's between "Code" and "Pull Requests".
2. Open a new issue.
3. Add the RSS/Atom feed for your website/blog/podcast.
4. Submit your issue.

## Rules for Contributors

1. **No Nazi/alt-right/alt-lite/neo-reactionary/redpill feeds.** Add them to your own feeds if you like, but pull requests containing feeds for sites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Daily Stormer will go straight to /dev/null and their submitters will be banned.
2. All news/opinion site URLs should be appropriately tagged. You'll find examples for *Jacobin* and the *National Review* in the ```urls``` file.
3. NSFW feeds are OK (such as webcomics like Oglaf or Sexy Losers) but should be tagged "nsfw".
4. Don't deface listings for feeds published by people you dislike.

  <dd>Why not? RSS/Atom feeds are cool old tech that allow individuals to keep up with the rest of the web (or their preferred subset thereof) at their own convenience.</dd>
  <dt>What if I don't use newsboat?</dt>
  <dd>You should be able to use this list to populate your preferred feed reader with a little work. It's plain text.</dd>
  <dt>Can I remove feeds I don't want from my copy?</dt>
  <dd>Of course you can. Take a copy, and do whatever you like with it.</dd>
