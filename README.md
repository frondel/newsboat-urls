# newsboat-urls

This is a "urls" file used by the [newsboat console feed reader](https://newsboat.org) to fetch feeds. It's the file I use myself, and you're welcome to use it and add to it, too!

## How to Use

1. ```$ mkdir ~/.newsboat``` if you haven't already
2. Copy the "urls" file to ```~/.newsboat/urls``` or append its contents to your existing ```urls``` file.
3. Restart newsboat.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Add your favorite RSS/Atom feed URLs with tags or add tags to existing feeds
3. Commit
4. File a pull request
5. If I don't merge within a day, hit me up on [Mastodon](https://octodon.social/@starbreaker) and remind me.

## Rules for Contributors

1. **No Nazi/alt-right/alt-lite/neo-reactionary/redpill feeds.** Add them to your own feeds if you like, but pull requests containing feeds for sites like Breitbart, Infowars, and the Daily Stormer will go straight to /dev/null and their submitters will be banned.
2. All news/opinion site URLs should be appropriately tagged. 
  1. For example, the feed for *Jacobin* should show up as "https://jacobinmag.com/feed/ news opinion politics left socialism communism".
  2. Likewise, the feed for the *National Review* should show up as "https://www.nationalreview.com/feed/ news opinion politics 'center-right' conservative".
3. NSFW feeds are OK (such as webcomics like Oglaf or Sexy Losers) but should be tagged "nsfw".
4. Don't deface listings for feeds published by people you dislike.
